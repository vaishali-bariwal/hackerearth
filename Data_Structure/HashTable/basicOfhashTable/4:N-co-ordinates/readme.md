Note : For this question use PAIRS for taking input, and then do it, don't use map.

There are 'N' 2-D co-ordinate points given. Now , you have to print the co-ordinate point, followed by their frequencies, See sample I/O,

Print the coordinate points in the Lexicographical order.

Input :

First line contains an integer 'N' , i.e the no. of 2-D coordinate points given.
Next N line contains, two space separated integers x and y, defining x-coordinate and y- coordinate respectively .
Output:

Three space separated integers, first one defines the x-coordinate, second integer define y-coordinate and third integer defines the frequency of (x,y).
Constraints:

1<= N <=100000
-10^9<= x,y <=10^9

Explanation
There are 5 coordinates given .

(1,1) occurs 2 times.

(1,3) occurs 2 times.

(2,1) occurs 1 time.
