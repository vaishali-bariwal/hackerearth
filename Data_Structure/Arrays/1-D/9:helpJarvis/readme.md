Tony Stark is in the planet Titan crying for his friends are turning into ashes, and on earth mayhem has ensued since a lot of people are turning into ashes too. Some trains have been derailed in such a way that a lot of its coaches are thrown off in a random disarray like coach 3, 4 and 5 are thrown off in one place, coach 2 and 6 are thrown off in another place, etc.

S.H.I.E.L.D calls upon Hulk and jarvis to help them collect and connect some the thrown off coaches of those trains, but a train can only move if the collected coaches number are in a continuous manner (need not to be in order) ,like 1234, 2314, 4123, 2341  etc.

Help Jarvis write a program for hulk to decide whether collected coaches will move or not.

Input Format:

First ilne contains one number t , denoting the number of test cases.
