Amy has written N numbers in her maths notebook. She is interested in knowing how many of them can be represented in the form of 2^x (^ means power).

Input : First line conatins N (No of integers) Next N line conatins an integer y.

Output: No of numbers that can be written as 2^x

Constraints : 1<=N<=100000 1<=y<=2^(32)

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
1
2
3
4
5
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
3
Explanation
1=2^0 2=2^1 4=2^2

so, total no of numbers which can be represented in form of 2^x is 3
