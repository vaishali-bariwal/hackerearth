It is winter time and the cold breezes make coder panda feel sleepy all the day. As he is fond of solving questions, he decided to utilize these vacations. He makes a plan of solving questions in following manner:-

On first day he decides to solve 1 question , then with each passing day , number of questions will get doubled  (i.e on second day 2 questions, on third day 4 questions, on fourth day 8 questions and so on). But on some days, due to his laziness he just sleeps all the day and doesn't practice a single question  .

Now you are given an integer N denoting the total number of questions Lazy Panda solved in the vacation . Determine the number of days Lazy Panda was active. An active day means solving all the questions of that particular day.
