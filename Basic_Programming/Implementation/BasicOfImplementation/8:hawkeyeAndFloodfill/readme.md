Hawkeye is a MARVEL character who has a perfect aim in archery. Its almost impossible for him to miss his aim. As you are the head of technical team at MARVEL , you have been assigned a very critical task. During practice hawkeye uses a square archery practice board. For our convenience we will assume it to be a N * N matrix. He shoots an arrow at position i,j with power P. Now power reduces by 1 as we move away from position i,j . Your task is to show the graph representing the impact of the arrow on the practice board.

INPUT FORMAT
First line of input contains a single integer N denoting the size of the practice board.
Second line contains 3 integers i,j denoting position at which arrow was shot and p denoting the power used to shoot the arrow.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Output a 2D matrix representing the impact on the practice board.

CONSTRAINS
1<=N<=1000
0<=i,j 0<=p<=109

Note:- The matrix is zero indexed matrix ie: first element will be at 0,0
SAMPLE INPUT 
7
3 3 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT 

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 
0 1 2 2 2 1 0 
0 1 2 3 2 1 0 
0 1 2 2 2 1 0 
0 1 1 1 1 1 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Explanation
The size of the practice board is 7*7
Hawkeye shoots an arrow at 3,3 position with power 3.
So, at every layer the impact reduces by 1 until impact becomes 0
