≤
2
∗
n
 such that every adjacent elements of the array have a edge between them in the given graph.

UPDATE

If there are multiple solutions please output anyone of them.

All vertices of the graph should be present in the array

sorry for delay in announcment :(

INPUT

First line of Input contain 2 integers n and m as specified in the problem statement.

OUTPUT

Print size of the array in the first line of your output print the array in second line of the output.

CONSTRAINTS
```
n≤4*10^5
m≤10^6

SAMPLE INPUT

1 2
1 3
2 3
SAMPLE OUTPUT
