All over the world, peoples are working on energy solution. It would be a tough time for our next generation to survive if we don’t think about solution. Tony stark is working on a new project and wants to display his project using “seven segment display - concept”. Tony Stark gave Jarvis a task to find a number from his Favorite list of number for which the energy consumption is lowest.

(Assuming that for a digit to represent Tony stark is using 7 bulbs and only those bulbs light up which are required to represent a number and rest other would be completely off.)

Help Jarvis and conserve energy.
