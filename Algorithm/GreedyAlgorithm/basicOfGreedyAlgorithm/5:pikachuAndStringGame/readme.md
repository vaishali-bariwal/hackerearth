t
. Both the moves 
s

t
 contain the same number of letters.

In a single day, Pikachu can increase any letter of move 
s
 by one, that is, in a single day, he can convert letter

C
 to 
D
, 
M
 to 
N

Z
 to letter 
A

Pikachu just realized he also has a hidden ability. It can help him increase any letter of move 
s
 by 
13
,  that is, in a single day, he can convert letter 
A
 to letter 
N
, 
B
 into 
O
