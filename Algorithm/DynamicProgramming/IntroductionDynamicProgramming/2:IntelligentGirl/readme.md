Soumika has a string S and its starting index is 1. The string S consists of characters from 
1
−
9
. As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay Tendulkar. She asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number of even numbered characters ( i.e  
2
,
4
,
6
,
8
 ) for every index i  
(
1
≤
i
≤
|
S
|
)
. For an index i, the result should be calculated from i to the end of the string. As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help him find the solution.

Input:
First line contains a string S.

Output:
Print |S| space-separated integers,the result of every index.

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 
10
4

SAMPLE INPUT

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
7 7 7 6 5 5 4 4 3 2 1 1
Explanation
Given string S is 
574674546476
.
for index 1
Number of even numbers from 5 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 1 is 7.
for index 2
Number of even numbers from 7 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 2 is 7.
for index 3
Number of even numbers from 4 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 3 is 7.
for index 3
Number of even numbers from 6 to end of the string is 6 so the result of index 4 is 6.....
