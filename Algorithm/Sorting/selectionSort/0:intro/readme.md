You are given an array a, size of the array N and an integer x. Follow the above algorithm and print the state of the array after x iterations have been performed.

Input Format

The first line contains two integer N and x denoting the size of the array and the steps of the above algorithm to be performed respectively. The next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output Format

Print N space separated integers denoting the state of the array after x steps
