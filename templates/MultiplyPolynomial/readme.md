Multiply two polynomials

Given two polynomials represented by two arrays, write a function that multiplies given two polynomials.

Example:

Input:  A[] = {5, 0, 10, 6} 
        B[] = {1, 2, 4} 
Output: prod[] = {5, 10, 30, 26, 52, 24}

The first input array represents "5 + 0x^1 + 10x^2 + 6x^3"
The second array represents "1 + 2x^1 + 4x^2" 
And Output is "5 + 10x^1 + 30x^2 + 26x^3 + 52x^4 + 24x^5"
